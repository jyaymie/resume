## About

I created an npm package that allows you to print out my resume right in your console.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Install the project dependencies with `npm install` and open the project in your code editor.
4. In your terminal, enter `node index.js` and ta-da! My resume should be displayed.
